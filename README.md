# beaniecrown

This program is written with the intent to help with the calculation of the crown decreases on a beanie knitted 
on circular needles. The program inputs a total stitch count in the round, determines the available decrease
methods, and after one is chosen by the user, produces a table of stiches per row and an illustration.

On Ubuntu, tkinter is required for drawing
